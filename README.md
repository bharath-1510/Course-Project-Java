# TicketBooking
This project based on Open Air Theatre Ticket Booking.

<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>This software system will be a Movie Ticket Booking System.
This system will be designed to maximize the easiness of the customers to book tickets, which would otherwise have to be booked
by standing in long queues at the theaters.More specifically, this
system is designed to allow a customer to book and cancel his
tickets at any time of the day. This software will inform the
customer by sending an E-mail, confirming his booking of his
tickets. Pre-formatted reply forms are used in every stage of the
ticketsâ€™ booked progress through the system to provide a uniform
review process. The system also contains a relational database
containing a list of Movies, Timings, Seats, Prices and Bookings.</p>
